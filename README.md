# Embedded Operating Systems

This repository collects most of the code that I developed during the 2024 Spring Semester Embedded Operating Systems[^syllabus], instructed by Prof. HUANG, YU-LUN. It includes lab and homework assignments. Lab assignments correspond to a single course topic and are given after each practical session. Homework assignments encompass multiple course topics and are given once the relevant topics have been covered.

The code for our groupâ€™s final project is stored in the [Dinglet/eos_final](https://github.com/Dinglet/eos_final) repository on GitHub. However, it contains only a portion of the entire project. This is because some group members have not uploaded their code portions to this repository.
