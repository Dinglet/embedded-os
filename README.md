## Lab 3: Driver (Part I) - Using GPIO in Raspberry Pi

In this lab 3-1, we follow "Device Driver 35 - GPIO Driver Basic"[^1] to be familiar with using GPIO and its driver. The original sources of the device driver and makefile are from the following subdirectory of their GitHub repository: https://github.com/Embetronicx/Tutorials/tree/master/Linux/Device_Driver/GPIO-in-Linux-Device-Driver.
