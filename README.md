# Embedded Operating Systems

This repository collects most of the code that I developed during the 2024 Spring Semester Embedded Operating Systems[^syllabus], instructed by Prof. HUANG, YU-LUN. It includes lab and homework assignments. Lab assignments correspond to a single course topic and are given after each practical session. Homework assignments encompass multiple course topics and are given once the relevant topics have been covered.
