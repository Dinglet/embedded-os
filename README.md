# Embedded Operating Systems

This repository collects most of the code that I developed during the 2024 Spring Semester Embedded Operating Systems[^syllabus], instructed by Prof. HUANG, YU-LUN. It includes lab and homework assignments. Lab assignments correspond to a single course topic and are given after each practical session. Homework assignments encompass multiple course topics and are given once the relevant topics have been covered.

## Lab 3: Driver (Part I) - Using GPIO in Raspberry Pi

Deadline: 2024-04-04

In this lab 3-1, we follow "Device Driver 35 - GPIO Driver Basic"[^1] to be familiar with using GPIO and its driver. The original sources of the device driver and makefile are from the following subdirectory of their GitHub repository: https://github.com/Embetronicx/Tutorials/tree/master/Linux/Device_Driver/GPIO-in-Linux-Device-Driver.
