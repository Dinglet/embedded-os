# Lab 3: Driver (Part I) - Using GPIO in Raspberry Pi

In this lab 3-1, we follow the "GPIO Driver Basic"[^gpio-driver-basic-using-raspberry-pi] provided by EmbeTronicX to be familiar with using GPIO and its driver. The original sources of the device driver and makefile are located in the subdirectory `Linux/Device_Driver/GPIO-in-Linux-Device-Driver` of the GitHub repository `Embetronicx/Tutorials`[^Tutorials].
